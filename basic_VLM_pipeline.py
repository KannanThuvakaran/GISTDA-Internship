"""
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather a dataset of satellite images along with corresponding textual descriptions or prompts that provide context or information about the images.
Preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, normalization) and the textual data (e.g., tokenization, encoding).
Model Architecture:

Design a model architecture that combines both visual and textual inputs. This could involve a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for processing images and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer-based models for processing text.
You could explore architectures like multimodal transformers, which are specifically designed to handle both visual and textual inputs.
Training:

Train the model on your dataset using a suitable loss function that accounts for both the visual and textual components.
Fine-tune the model using techniques like transfer learning if you have access to pre-trained models that are relevant to your task.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics such as accuracy, BLEU score (for text generation), or other domain-specific metrics.
Validate the model's outputs qualitatively by visually inspecting the generated responses and comparing them to ground truth annotations.
Deployment:

Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a suitable environment where it can take satellite images and prompts as input and generate answers.
Ensure that the deployment setup is scalable, efficient, and meets any constraints or requirements specific to your application.
Iterative Improvement:

Continuously monitor the model's performance in real-world scenarios and gather feedback from users.
Iterate on the model architecture, training data, or other components based on insights gained from evaluation and user feedback.
