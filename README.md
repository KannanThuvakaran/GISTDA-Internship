## Complications with VLMs for Remote Sensing

### Good VLMs are produceds with a large dataset of image-text pairs.

#### In computer vision, recent research has demonstrated that fine-tuning large vision language models on small-scale, high-quality datasets can yield impressive performance in visual and language understanding.

#### Classification is a fundamental task in remote sensing data analysis, where the goal is to assign a semantic label to each image, such as 'urban', 'forest', 'agricultural land', etc. The process of assigning labels to an image is known as image-level classification. However, in some cases, a single image might contain multiple different land cover types, such as a forest with a river running through it, or a city with both residential and commercial areas. In these cases, image-level classification becomes more complex and involves assigning multiple labels to a single image. This can be accomplished using a combination of feature extraction and machine learning algorithms to accurately identify the different land cover types. It is important to note that image-level classification should not be confused with pixel-level classification, also known as semantic segmentation. While image-level classification assigns a single label to an entire image, semantic segmentation assigns a label to each individual pixel in an image, resulting in a highly detailed and accurate representation of the land cover types in an image.
